# Welcome to Cave Lords!
![Orky](/mygame/images/cave_lords_icon_4.png)

This is a community learning project for game dev in Ruby with DragonRuby. We'll be doing TDD with RSpec. I'm a complete n00b at game dev, so we'll learn together!

## But Chris, WHY are you doing this?
1. Because game dev is a very different way of thinking from web dev and this will stretch the programming muscles
2. Because I'm a big gamer and I've always wanted to understand how this stuff works.
3. Because it seemed like folks were interested in this, so it should make for an entertaining show.
4. Because I want to, so there!

## What Kind of Game is This?
The game will _attempt_ to be a top down, sprite-based, deep colony sim (think "Dwarf Fortress", "Rimworld", etc.) Except we'll be the "bad guys" in this one, playing orcs/goblins/somekindanasties instead of those weirdo hooman creatures (because that's just boring)!

Initially, I'm planning to divide the code into two major parts: procedural world generation and game play. No idea how to do either, so we'll learn together!

## How Do I Run This Locally?
1. clone the repo
2. cd into the project root
3. `./dragonruby`
4. **have fun!**

## Chris, this is awesome! I want to play too! How?
There are lots of ways to contribute to this project!  And most of them don't cost a thing! Here are a few:

- test the game and create bug tickets if you break something!
- suggest improvements to the game or the code. Throw an enhancement ticket in!
- pick a ticket and fix it with a PR you freakin' genius! (make sure you branch from "develop")
- join me on the live stream on YouTube or Twitch every Tuesday at 3pm EST and be part of the discussion! Snarky comments, sarcasm and Dad Jokes are welcome!
- join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/d9xWFjBraq) and hang out in the cave-lords-pond!
- follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duckiedevshow) cause it makes me feel loved!

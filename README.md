Welcome to Cave Lords!

This is just a community learning project for game dev in Ruby with Gosu. We'll be doing TDD with RSpec. I'm a complete n00b at game dev, so we'll learn together!

WHY am I doing this? Because I'm a big gamer and I've always wanted to understand how this stuff works. Also, it seemed like folks were really interested in me doing this. Also also, I want to, so there!

The game will attempt to be a top down, sprite-based, deep colony sim (think "Dwarf Fortress", "Rimworld", etc.). Except we'll be the "bad guys" in this one, playing orcs/goblins/somekindanasties instead of those weirdo hooman creatures (because that's just boring)!

Initially, I'm going to divide this into two major parts: world building and game play. No idea how to do either, so we'll learn together!

Nothing much to see here yet, but it's what we'll work on during the Coding with Chris live sessions starting in Jan 2023! Keep watching this space and I'll make sure to forget to update it and update Twitter (@duckiedevshow) and Discord (https://discord.gg/d9xWFjBraq) instead! :D
